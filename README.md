We propose an interactive colorization framework that uses sparse user scribbles and an edgeâ€‘enhancing network to reduce colorâ€‘bleeding artifacts along object boundaries. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, COCOâ€‘Stuff and Places205 demonstrate significant improvements over stateâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘art baselines in PSNR, LPIPS and a novel Cluster Discrepancy Ratio (CDR) metric.
